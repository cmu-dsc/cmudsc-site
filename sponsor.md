Being the largest data science organization at Carnegie Mellon, we offer exciting opportunities to our sponsors, through our resume book, and our reach when it comes to co-hosting and promoting events. As our organization hosts projects, workshops, competitions, and a mentorship program, we can also identify members who do outstanding data science work. If you are interested in sponsoring us and would like to discuss, please send us an email to [datascienceclub@cmu.edu](mailto:datascienceclub@cmu.edu)!
